# Network-Security-and-Computer-Networks

This repository contains a collection of projects, configurations, and notes related to Computer Networking and Network Security.

## About The Project

This project aims to showcase fundamental and advanced concepts in computer networking and network security. It includes labs, simulations, and practical implementations using tools such as Cisco Packet Tracer and Wireshark, alongside theoretical insights.

General Information:  
Computer Networking involves the design, implementation, and management of interconnected systems for communication and data sharing. Network Security focuses on protecting data during transmission and ensuring systems are safeguarded from unauthorized access and cyber threats. Together, these fields are essential in today’s digital world for building secure and efficient IT infrastructures.
